# Requizit

Requizit is a prototype for an online quiz platform, dedicated to improving the educational experiences of online learning. Its aim is to use the concepts of spaced repetition, tailored content and collaborative learning to ensure that its student user base learns just as effectively, if not more so, than in the physical classroom.

This prototype was created for the 2021 UNSW Computer Science and Engineering Society Hackathon.
